  <h2>About Me</h2>
  
  <p>I specialize in low-level systems and infrastructure, with a focus on correctness, clarity, and architectural coherence. My projects revolve around Rust, Linux, and self-hosted environments—where understanding the full execution path is essential.</p>
  
  <p>I value well-structured software: code that communicates intent clearly, resists unnecessary complexity, and stays maintainable over time.</p>

### Experience
Extensive hands-on work with personal Rust projects (tools, daemons, and more), including self-hosting on Linux servers.

### Working On
Currently diving deeper into systems programming and infrastructure design, exploring runtime internals and operational workflows. Contributions focus on pinned or starred repositories, prioritizing deliberate architecture and long-term maintainability.
