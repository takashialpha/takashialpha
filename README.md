## Overview

I build systems with deliberate abstractions and transparent execution paths. My work focuses on Rust, Linux infrastructure, and self-hosted environments.

Good software communicates intent explicitly, resists accidental complexity, and remains intelligible under scrutiny. Code is a medium of communication for humans first, a set of instructions for machines second, even on low-level setups.
