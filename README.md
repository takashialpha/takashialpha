<h3>about me</h3>
I work on low-level systems and infrastructure, with a focus on correctness, clarity, and architectural coherence. My projects are built around Rust, Linux, and self-hosted environments, where understanding the full execution path is a requirement rather than a convenience.
I value systems that are well-written: software whose structure communicates intent, resists accidental complexity, and remains readable over time.

<h3>experience</h3>

i have experience coding my own rust projects and occasionally self-hosting them.

my main technologies:
