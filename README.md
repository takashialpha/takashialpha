### About Me

I specialize in low-level systems and infrastructure, emphasizing correctness, clarity, and architectural coherence. My projects center on Rust, Linux, and self-hosted environments, where a deep understanding of the full execution path is essential.

I prioritize well-structured software: code that clearly communicates intent, minimizes unnecessary complexity, and remains maintainable over time.

### Experience

Extensive experience developing personal Rust projects, including tools and daemons, with occasional self-hosting on Linux servers.

### Main Technologies

### Design Principles

- Code is a medium of communication
- Structure should make intent explicit
- Resist accidental complexity

### Working On

Currently studying systems programming and infrastructure design in depth, focusing on runtime internals and operational workflows. My main contributions are to pinned or starred repositories, ensuring deliberate architecture and long-term maintainability.
