<h3>About me</h3>
I work on low-level systems and infrastructure, with a focus on correctness, clarity, and architectural coherence. My projects are built around Rust, Linux, and self-hosted environments, where understanding the full execution path is a requirement rather than a convenience.
I value systems that are well-written: software whose structure communicates intent, resists accidental complexity, and remains readable over time.

<h3>Experience</h3>

I have a huge experience coding my own rust projects and occasionally self-hosting them.

<h3>My main technologies</h3>

<h3>Design principles</h3>
Code is a medium of communication;
Structure should make intent explicit;

I am always active there, feel free to contact me.

<h3>Working on</h3>
I’m currently studying systems programming and infrastructure design, concentrating on projects that deepen my understanding of runtime internals and operational workflows. I mainly contribute to my pinned or starred repositories, ensuring every contribution reflects deliberate architecture and maintainable design.
