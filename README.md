## Overview
I work on **low-level systems and infrastructure**, with a focus on correctness, clarity, and architectural coherence.  
My projects are built around **Rust**, **Linux**, and **self-hosted environments**, where understanding the full execution path is a requirement rather than a convenience.

I value systems that are well-written: software whose structure communicates intent, resists accidental complexity, and remains readable over time.

## What I Build
- Low-level services and utilities with explicit control over behavior
- Self-hosted systems designed for durability and observability
- Infrastructure that emphasizes clear boundaries and predictable failure modes

I primarily contribute to **my own repositories**, where architectural discipline and long-term consistency can be preserved.

## Interests
- Systems programming and runtime internals
- Infrastructure and service architecture
- Automation as a tool for correctness
- Software that remains comprehensible

---

## Design Principles
- Code is a medium of communication
- Structure should make intent explicit
- Abstractions must justify their existence
- A system is defined by its failure semantics
