## Overview

I build systems where abstractions are deliberate and execution paths remain transparent. My work centers on Rust, Linux infrastructure, and self-hosted environments—domains.

Good software communicates intent explicitly, resists accidental complexity, and remains intelligible under scrutiny. Code is a medium of communication for humans first, a set of instructions for machines second, even on low-level setups.
