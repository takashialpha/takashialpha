## Philosophy

I build systems where abstractions are deliberate and execution paths remain transparent. My work centers on Rust, Linux infrastructure, and self-hosted environments—domains where precision and architectural clarity are non-negotiable.

Good software communicates intent explicitly, resists accidental complexity, and remains intelligible under scrutiny. Code is a medium of communication first, a set of instructions second.

## Technical Focus

**Systems Programming** • Low-level tooling and daemons in Rust  
**Infrastructure** • Self-hosted Linux environments and operational workflows  
**Architecture** • Designs that prioritize correctness, maintainability, and structural coherence
